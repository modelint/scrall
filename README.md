# Scrall
Scrall = Starr's Concise Relational Action Language

This is the pseudo-code that I use to write all the action language in my Executable UML models.

For now, the only useful artifact is the PDF description. Feel free to download it for bedtime reading. It is generated from markdown and I will paste all that into the wiki soon.

We've been having great success translating this to the open source micca platform (on Fossil, not Github) which generates efficient C code from the complete Executable UML models.

I am planning to develop a complete arpeggio grammar to support Scrall. When it is complete, this will no longer be psuedo-code.

This language will be consistent with the [Shlaer Mellor Metamodel](https://github.com/modelint/shlaer-mellor-metamodel) also in development.
